# Responsive Landing Page

This project is a **responsive landing page** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a modern navigation bar, a hero section, and adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes. The navigation menu collapses into a mobile-friendly toggle menu on smaller devices.

## Features

- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Navigation bar with clickable menu items
- Mobile menu toggle using a menu icon
- Clean and modern layout
- Utilizes [Remix Icon](https://remixicon.com/) for icons

## How It Works

- **HTML** structures the content and navigation.
- **CSS** (with media queries) ensures the layout adapts to all screen sizes.
- **JavaScript** enables the mobile menu toggle functionality.

## Learning Journey

I created this project with the help of **AI tools** like GitHub Copilot, which assisted me in:
- Writing and debugging responsive CSS media queries
- Implementing JavaScript for menu toggling
- Structuring semantic and accessible HTML
- Understanding best practices for responsive web design

Through this process, I learned:
- How to use media queries for mobile responsiveness
- How to toggle classes in JavaScript to show/hide elements
- The importance of semantic HTML and accessible navigation
- How to integrate icon libraries like Remix Icon

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Resize the browser window to see the responsive navigation in action.
